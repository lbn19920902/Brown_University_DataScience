Problem 1) n-dimensional random walk
Starting from the origin O, a particle moves randomly +/- 1 step along each axis of an n-dimensional space. The probability of stepping +1 or -1 step along each axis is 50-50. After a step is taken, the move is repeated from the new position, and so on. If the walk continues forever, what is the probability that the particle returns to the origin O if n = 1, 2, and 3? Please solve this problem numerically and send us your code, a report to walk us through your solution. Hint: the problem has an analytical solution. Please use the analytical solution to verify your numerical approach.

Problem 2) Select one of the kaggle datasets from the list below and advance as far as you can on a machine learning pipeline/workflow. You can either create a kaggle kernel and send us the link to your kernel, or send back a report with your source code and walk us through your solution. Please follow these general steps:
- Feature exploration and visualization to understand the dataset
- Propose an interesting and useful problem that can be answered with the dataset using machine learning (supervised or unsupervised).
- Perform feature engineering
- Use a machine learning tool of your choice to answer your proposed question.
The first three datasets are similar to the administrative datasets we usually work with. We also collaborate with Brown faculty on science projects and the other three datasets are typical examples of such projects.
